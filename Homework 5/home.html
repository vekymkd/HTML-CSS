                    <h2>I. WHAT MAKES UACS SCSIT A LEADING IT SCHOOL IN MACEDONIA?</h2>
                    <p class="dark">UACS SCSIT holds the first place in Macedonia in number of scientific paper
                        downloads on the Internet (more than 1300 computer engineers have paid to download the paper
                        from the prestigious computer association – Association for Computing Machinery – ACM).</p>
                    <p class="dark">In the past two years, UACS SCSIT faculty and students have published more than 17
                        scientific and research papers in international journals or have presented them at conferences.
                        Two of those papers have received an impact factor.</p>
                    <p class="dark">UACS SCSIT has been awarded a certificate from the Ministry of Education and Science
                        of the Republic of Macedonia for a paper published in a journal with impact factor.</p>
                    <p class="dark">Some of the most esteemed and well-known professionals from the Macedonian business
                        community teach undergraduate and graduate courses at UACS SCSIT.</p>
                    <h2>II.OUR FACILITY</h2>
                    <p class="dark">UACS SCSIT professors and associates work closely with the students in order to pay
                        attention to each student individually, to develop their talents and to offer guidance about the
                        area of study they like the most.</p>
                    <p class="dark">UACS SCSIT regularly engages professors or experts who have completed their
                        educational process and/or currently work in other European countries and in the USA. Therefore,
                        the students can gain more experience and establish professional networks with institutions
                        outside Macedonia.</p>
                    <p class="dark">Apart from their teaching and research activities, some of UACS SCSIT faculty also
                        hold managerial positions in the IT Association of the Republic of Macedonia. Therefore, they
                        organize symposia and other activities related to the promotion and development of the
                        information technology in Macedonia. They regularly participate in international scientific and
                        research conferences and projects and they are currently working on projects in Europe and the
                        USA.</p>
                    <p class="dark">The student/teacher ratio at UACS SCSIT is less than 10:1, a ratio that indicates
                        (guarantees) individual attention to each student.</p>
